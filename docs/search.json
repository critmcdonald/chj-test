    "text": "About R chunks\nWhile you used the R console above to interact with R (yes, that is what you were doing), we will mostly add code to our notebooks using code chunks.\n\nIn this RStudio notebook in the code chunk below, click on the green play button to run the code in the chunk.\nYou should get a response something like [1] 2 which is a row number [1] and the answer to the match equation 2.\n\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThere is a keyboard command to run a line of code, and it is among five key commands we really suggest you use. Presented for Mac:\n\nCmd-return runs a single line of code that your cursor is on.\nCmd-shift-return runs all the lines in the code chunk where your cursor is.\n\nAll of these options are also in the Run menu at the top of the document.\n\nOYO: Insert a code chunk\nThe best way to insert a new code chunk is to use the keyboard command Cmd-option-i. That said, there is also a green +c button above the document near that Run menu.\n\nIn the space below this direction but before the next headline, add a new code chunk using the keyboard command Cmd-option-i.\n\nNotice it adds all the characters needed and then puts your cursor inside so you are ready to type.\n\nInside that code chunk, add 2 + 2 and then run the chunk to see the answer.\n\n\n\nData frames and plots\nThere is a sample data set in R called cars that has the stopping distance of cars as measured some time in history. We’ll use it to show a couple more things about code blocks.\nThe code chunk below has two lines of code:\n\nThe first just says cars, which prints out the data.\nThe second line is a function called plot() with cars inside of it. That function acts on the cars data to create a scatter plot.\n\n\nRun the code below.\n\n\ncars\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nplot(cars)\n\n\n\n\nSince we have two lines with two different outputs, the Quarto notebook shows them as panes you can swap back and forth. The rendered page shows each line of code, then its output.\n\nThe data.frame part is printing out data. There is a lot of information available in that printout, including the number of rows (we call them observations) and columns (we call them variables), the names of those columns/variables, the data types of each variable, and then their values. We call data like this a “data frame” or “tibble”. It’s like a highly structured spreadsheet.\nThe second pane is a chart (or plot as we call them). The function plot() took the only two variables in the data and, well, plotted them.\n\nYes, it can be that easy to visualize data in R. But not usually.\n\n\nRender your first document\n\nWith this document open in R Studio, look at the toolbar directly above the writing and look for the Render button with the blue arrow next to it. Click on that word.\nThis will create (or render) a “publishable” version of this document in HTML and present it in the Viewer page (or perhaps in a new window, which we can fix).\n\nYou can read this lesson text there, but realize that rendered page doesn’t update with edits in the Quarto document unless you tell it to.\nKeep this in mind:\n\nThere are keyboard commands to render a document: Cmd-shift-k.\nWe can also easily publish the same work in other formats, like PDF, Word or even a slide show.\nWe can also choose NOT to “publish” our work. We don’t have to share our work on the internet, we are just ready if we want to.\n\n\n\nOYO: Re-render this page one last time\nNow that you’ve been introduced to how a Quarto document is written, go ahead and re-render this page by using the ."

    "text": "An opinionated list of the most common data wrangling functions. It leans heavily into the Tidyverse.\n\n\n\nread_csv() imports data from a CSV file. (It handles data types better than the base R read.csv()). Also write_csv() when you need export as CSV. Example: read_csv(\"path/to/file.csv\").\nwrite_rds to save a data frame as an .rds R data data file. This preserves all the data types. read_rds() to import R data. Example: read_rds(\"path/to/file.rds\").\nreadxl is a package we didn’t use, but it has read_excel() that allows you to import from an Excel file, including specified sheets and ranges.\nclean_names() from the library(janitor) package standardizes column names.\n\n\n\n\n\nselect() to select columns. Example: select(col01, col02) or select(-excluded_col).\nrename() to rename a column. Example: rename(new_name = old_name).\nfilter() to filter rows of data. Example: filter(column_name == \"value\").\n\nSee Relational Operators like ==, &gt;, &gt;= etc.\nSee Logical operators like &, | etc.\nSee is.na tests if a value is missing.\n\ndistinct() will filter rows down to the unique values of the columns given.\narrange() sorts data based on values in a column. Use desc() to reverse the order. Example: arrange(col_name %&gt;% desc())\nmutate() changes and existing column or creates a new one. Example: mutate(new_col = (col01 / col02)).\nround() is a base R function that can round a number to a set decimal point. Often used within a mutate() function.\nrecode(), if_else() and case_when() are all functions that can be used with mutate() to create new categorizations with your data.\npivot_longer() “lengthens” data, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. Example: pivot_longer(cols = 3:5, names_to = \"new_key_col_name\", values_to = \"new_val_col_name\") will take the third through the fifth columns and turn each value into a new row of data. It will put them into two columns: The first column will have the name you give it in names_to and contain the old column name that corresponds to each value pivoted. The second column will have the name of whatever you set in values_to and will contain all the values from each of the columns.\npivot_wider() is the opposite of pivot_longer(). Example: pivot_wider(names_from = col_of_key_values, values_from = col_with_values). See the link.\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup_by() and summarize() often come together. When you use group_by(), every function after it is broken down by that grouping. We often add arrange() to these, calling this our GSA functions. Example: group_by(song, artist) %&gt;% summarize(weeks = n(), top_chart_position = min(peak_position)). To break or remove groupings, use ungroup().\ncount() is a shortcut for GSA that count the number rows based on variable groups you feed it.\n\n\n\n\nThese are the function often used within summarize():\n\nn() to count the number of rows. n_distinct() counts the unique values.\nsum() to add things together.\nmean() to get an average.\nmedian() to get the median.\nmin() to get the smallest value. max() for the largest.\n+, -, *, / are math operators similar to a calculator."

The best way to explain this is to show you an example.\n\nGo to this link in a new browser window: Major League Soccer salaries.\n\nThis is a website with all the code from a data journalism project. If you click on the navigation link for Cleaning you can read where the data come from and see all the steps I went through – with code and explanation – to process the data so I could work with it. And in the Analysis 2023 notebook you’ll see I set out with some questions for the data, and then I wrote the code to find my answers. Along with the way I wrote explanations of how and why I did what I did.\n\n\n\nQuarto Pub page\n\n\nThis website was created using Quarto and R, and the tool I used to write everything was RStudio.\nThis document you are reading is also a Quarto document. These lessons have explanations, instructions and code you can run right on your computer. You’ll also write and run some on your own code.\n\nThe written words and explanations are written in a syntax called Markdown. It’s a common language used by programmers to create documentation. It’s understandable as text, but also easily converted to other formats.\nThe programming code for data is writing in R in code chunks. We’ll introduce those in a moment."

It is what makes R beautiful.\nWhat happens is developers will find it difficult to do a certain task, so they will write code that solves that problem and save it into an R “package” so they can use it later. They share that code with the community, and suddenly the R garage has an “ultimate set of tools” that would make Spicoli’s dad proud.\nOne set of these tools is the tidyverse developed by Hadley Wickham and his team at Posit. It’s a set of R packages for data science that are designed to work together. I highly recommend Wickham’s book R for data science, which is free.\nThere are also a series of useful tidyverse cheatsheets that can help you as you use the packages and functions from the tidyverse. We’ll refer to these throughout the course.\n\nInstall packages we’ll use\n\nCopy the code below and paste it into Console of RStudio (The left pane). Hit return to run the code.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"quarto\", \"rmarkdown\", \"tidyverse\", \"janitor\"))\nYou’ll see a bunch of response fly by in the Console. It’s probably all fine unless it ends the last response with an error.\nThis installs R software packages onto your computer we’ll use later. You only have to install these packages once."

    "text": "Packages and libraries\nAfter the goals in a notebook, the next thing to have is the libraries you’ll use. While there is a lot of functionality baked into R, users can also write and package pre-written code into libraries. Different libraries have different “functions” that we use to manipulate our data in some way. Learning how to use these functions IS programming.\nWe almost always load the tidyverse library which is actually a collection of libraries, including:\n\nreadr has functions that import and export data\ndplyr functions manipulate data, like sorting and filtering\nstringr helps us work with text\ntidyr helps us shape data for different purposes\nggplot helps us visualize data through charts\n\nWe’ll use functions from all of these libraries, but they come in the one big toolbox, tidyverse.\nWe’ll use another function from another library, janitor to standardize some column names.\nHere is how we set up the libraries. It is usually the first code chunk you’ll have in your notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe code block below is displayed online in a special way to show you the tick marks, language designation and some execution options that are explained below. Usually the online directions only show the code inside the block.\n\n\nThis code chunk below has two special execution options that affect how the code works.\n\nlabel: setup gives this chunk a special name that tells RStudio to run this block before any other if it hasn’t been run already.\nmessage: false suppresses the usual messages we see in our notebook after loading libraries. Usually we want to see these messages, but not on this chunk because they are standard. Plus, I wanted to show you how the options work.\n\nExecution options are not required, but those two are useful for our libraries chunk. That’s often the only place I use any.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| message: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n\n\nIn your practice notebook after the ## Libraries headline, add a new code chunk. You can use the keyboard command Cmd+option+i or the green +C icon in the notebook toolbar.\nCopy the contents of the code block listed above and put it inside your code block. Include the execution options.\nRun the code block above using either the play button inside your Quarto document, or by placing your cursor in the code chunk and using Cmd-shift-return on your keyboard.\n\nYou’ll see a flash of green but you won’t see any feedback in your notebook because we suppressed it."

For a lot of functions in R the first argument is “what data are you taking about?” The pipe allows us to say “hey, take the data we just mucked with (i.e., the code before the pipe) and use that in this function.”\nYou can add other arguments to the new function.

Learn that one!\n\n\n\n\nA rabbit dives into a pipe\nThe concept of the pipe was first introduced by tidyverse developers in 2014 in a package called magrittr. They used the symbol %&gt;% as the pipe. It was so well received the concept was written directly into base R in 2021, but using the symbol |&gt;. Hadley Wickham’s 2022 rewriting of R for Data Science uses the base R pipe |&gt; by default. You can configure which to use in RStudio.\nThis switch to |&gt; is quite recent so you will still see %&gt;% used in our training and in documentation online. Assume |&gt; and %&gt;% are interchangeable."
